## Why use Docker

Docker is similar in concept to Virtual Machines, except itâ€™s much more lightweight. Instead of running an entire separate operating system (which is a massive overhead), Docker runs containers, which use the same host operating system, and only virtualize at a software level. Companies that use docker include ADP, Spotify and ING

Docker takes the same kind of version control and packaging that tools like Git and NPM provide and allows you to use it for your server software. Since your container is a single image, it makes it very easy to version track different builds of your container. And since everything is contained, it makes managing all of your dependencies much easier.

### Advantages of Docker
- Efficiency , container images can be used at every step of the deployment process
- Compatibility and maintainaility , docker images will run the same on different servers and laptops. less time wasted setting up environments.
- Simplicity , Code for configurations can easily be deployed
- Rapid deployments in seconds, container for each process and does not boot an operating system
- Continuous deployment and testing, consistent environments
- Multi-Cloud platforms, docker has high availability.
- Isolation of each containers contents and resources, this also ensures security.


## Installing Docker

Firstly you can install docker from dockers website, after this has been downloaded use the following commands and then then in order to check this is working type version and run hello-world.

```
"Docker Desktop Installer.exe"
Start-Process 'Docker Desktop Installer.exe' -Wait install
start /w "" "Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install

docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

## Login

Login to docker 

```
docker login
```
## Running a new nginx container

you can import docker containers from dockerhub by specifying their name and running them on a givern port for example:

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```
If 
## Linking Repositories

You can use the following commands to build and then push an image to your docker repositories, change the dockeraccount, repo and tag to the one listed, which you can find with the first command. This build command needs a Dockerfile to work.
a basic docker file follows the following format.



```
FROM nginx

LABEL MAINTAINER=jcole@spartaglobal

COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

```
docker images
docker ps
docker build -t dockeraccount/repo:tag
docker push dockeraccount/repo:tag

```

You can tag an image with the following , as it needs a tag to be pushed , using your own reponame and dockeraccount and the changes can be commmited with docker commit.

```
docker tag dockeraccount/repo
docker commit id dockeraccount/repo
docker push dockeraccount/repo
```

## Running your Image

The image can be run to display its content on a local server with the following, with your own dockeraccount , repo and tag. the 80:80 can be changed to your prefered port while keeping the second 80 as the port of the image , such as 100:80 .

```
ducker run -d -p 80:80 dockeracount/repo:tag
